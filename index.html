      <p id="first">My name is Brittany-Renee Davis. I am a digital marketer and content creator for a fashion line
        based in Los Angeles with showrooms around the nation. I also freelance as a content developer for multiple
        lines and fashion PR Firms located in the Arts District and the CMC.
      </p>
      <p>I graduated from Tamkang University in Taipei, Taiwan with a degree in business communications and am currently
        studying computer coding. In my free time, I write for an environmental sustainability blog and volunteer with
        the Koreatown homeless advocacy non-profit, "Ktown for All."
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this cohort, I hope to feel confident in implementing the tools I've learned to accomplish daily
        content tasks without using platforms such as Brandboom, Constant Contact or Squarespace.
